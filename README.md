## What is it?

TranslateMom is a web studio that turns any video or audio into perfectly timed, beautifully styled captions and multilingual transcripts. It began as a weekend hack to watch chinese cooking videos and grew into a full-blown SaaS trusted by indie creators, educators, and post-production teams.

### Why it matters

* **Speed without compromise** – Your file is queued, transcribed, and translated in minutes, not hours.
* **Creator-first UX** – Hotkeys, batch actions, and sensible defaults keep you in flow.
* **No walled gardens** – Export SRT, VTT, ASS, or burn-in MP4; bring your own storage if you like.
